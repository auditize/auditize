Get started    REST API       Send your logs to Auditize using an easy-to-use REST API.      Multi-tenancy       Partition your logs using log repositories. Each repository use its own database, and users and API keys can be granted different permissions on a specific set of repositories.      Log UI       Explore your logs with advanced search criteria, saveable filters, CSV export, and more.      Internationalization       Auditize is available in multiple languages and also supports internationalization of your logs through translation profiles.      Entity Mapping       Map your own organisational entities into Auditize. Entities can be anything: a customer, an organizational unit, a geographical location, etc. They can be used for log filtering but also to restrict user access to certain log entities.      Log data model <p>Auditize features a rich and flexible log data model. Given a base set of fields that allow you to describe the actor, the action, the resource, tags, etc. you can extend the actor and resource fields with custom fields. Source and details fields which are fully customizable allow you to provide additional context to the log.</p> <p>Files can also be attached to logs.</p> Web Component       Integrate the log interface right into your application frontend using a Web Component.

javascript function that retrieves an Auditize access token (and return it as a <code>Promise&lt;string&gt;</code>) from your own backend. <code>access-token-refresh-interval</code> no The interval in milliseconds at which the access token is refreshed. Default is 300000 (5 minutes). <code>lang</code> no The language to use in the Web Component (UI &amp; log translatable content). Default is <code>en</code>. <p>An access token is obtained by calling the <code>/api/auth/access-token</code> endpoint with an API key.
