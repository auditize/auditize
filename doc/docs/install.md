# Installation

Auditize is a Python 3.12+ application that uses MongoDB as a database and do not use the filesystem to persist data. It's base configuration is 100% environment variables based, making it easy and flexible to configure, especially in a Docker environment.

Auditize is composed of two distinct services:

- an [ASGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_Server_Gateway_Interface) web application that serves both the API and the frontend
- a scheduler that runs period tasks

It is delivered as a [Python package on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/auditize/) that can be installed with `pip` (the package installer for Python). Please note that the Auditize package dependencies are pinned to ensure a stable and reproducible installation.

The following sections will guide you through the installation of Auditize in two different contexts:

- a [Docker Compose environment](#docker-compose)
- a [standalone environment](#standalone)

!!! info "MongoDB"

    Auditize requires MongoDB 7.0+ to run.

    Auditize creates a main database named `auditize` in charge of storing the configuration data. For each new log repository, a dedicated database will be created with a name prefixed by `auditize_logs_`.

## Docker Compose

The Docker Compose environment described here provides a complete Auditize setup including MongoDB.

First, create an `auditize-docker` directory where you will store the various files related to your Auditize's Docker setup, and go to this directory:

```bash
mkdir auditize-docker
cd auditize-docker
```

Then, create a `Dockerfile` file with the following content:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.12

RUN pip install auditize

EXPOSE 80

ENTRYPOINT ["auditize"]
```

!!! warning

    This is a minimal Dockerfile that installs the `auditize` package and exposes the port 80. In a real-world / production setup, you would typically implement security and optimization measures such as:
    
    - running the application as a non-root user,
    - using a non-privileged port,
    - making the Docker image as small as possible by using an optimized base image,
    - pin the version of the `auditize` package to a specific version,
    - etc.

This image will be used to run both the web application and the scheduler Docker Compose services.

Now, build a Docker image from this Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t auditize .
```

Next, create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the same directory with the following content:
  
```yaml
services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo
    restart: always
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db
  web:
    image: auditize
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    command: ["serve", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "80"]
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    env_file: ".env"
    environment:
      - AUDITIZE_MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:root@mongo:27017/
  scheduler:
    image: auditize
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    command: ["schedule"]
    env_file: ".env"
    environment:
      - AUDITIZE_MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:root@mongo:27017/
      # we set PYTHONUNBUFFERED, otherwise the print() from "schedule" are not shown
      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
volumes:
  mongo-data:
```

This `docker-compose.yml` uses a `.env` file for the Auditize base-configuration, so let's create a `.env` file in the same directory with at least the following configuration elements:

```bash
AUDITIZE_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:8000
AUDITIZE_JWT_SIGNING_KEY=YOUR_AUDITIZE_JWT_SIGNING_KEY
```

- `AUDITIZE_PUBLIC_URL` is the public URL of your Auditize instance from which the web application will be accessed by your users or API clients (e.g. `https://auditize.example.com`). It is used to generate URLs in the emails sent by Auditize.
- `AUDITIZE_JWT_SIGNING_KEY` is the key used to sign the JWT tokens generated by Auditize (e.g. user sessions).

Please refer to the [configuration documentation](config.md) for more details.

Finally, start the Docker containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Before you can use Auditize, you need to create a superadmin user. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it auditize-docker-web-1 auditize bootstrap-superadmin YOUR_EMAIL YOUR_FIRST_NAME YOUR_LAST_NAME 
```

Where:

- `auditize-docker-web-1` is the name of the web container to run the command from
- `YOUR_EMAIL`, `YOUR_FIRST_NAME`, and `YOUR_LAST_NAME` must be replaced by your actual user information

The command will prompt you for a password and then create the superadmin user.

You can now access Auditize at `http://localhost:8000` and log in with the superadmin user you just created.

### Using Gunicorn

The previous setup uses `auditize serve` to run the web application. What this command does under the hood is to run the [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) ASGI server with one worker. You may want to use [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) with multiple workers for better performance as recommended in the [Uvicorn documentation](https://www.uvicorn.org/#running-with-gunicorn).

In this case, you can follow the same steps as above but make the following change in `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
# RUN pip install auditize
RUN pip install auditize gunicorn
```

And this change in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
# command: ["serve", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "80"]
entrypoint:
  [
    "gunicorn",
    "auditize:asgi()",
    "-k",
    "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker",
    "-w",
    "4",
    "-b",
    "0.0.0.0:80",
  ]
```

In this example, Gunicorn is configured to run 4 workers with the Uvicorn worker class. You can adjust the number of workers according to your needs / host resources.

!!! note

    Since Auditize is an ASGI application, you can use any other ASGI server to run it instead of Uvicorn or Uvicorn+Gunicorn.

### Ngnix, TLS, Kubernetes and beyond

The Docker Compose environment described above is a good starting point to run Auditize in a development/test environment. For a production deployment, you may consider:

- using a reverse proxy such as Nginx to serve the web application and handle TLS termination,
- deploying Auditize in a Kubernetes cluster with a proper ingress controller,
- build a custom Docker image with security and optimization measures,
- etc.

When deploying Auditize in a Kubernetes cluster, you have the flexibility to scale it by choosing between multiple pods running directly with Uvicorn and a single worker (through `auditize serve`) or using Gunicorn with multiple workers. Using Uvicorn directly in each pod can be simpler and more lightweight, making it easier to manage and scale horizontally. The FastAPI documentation provides [more information](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/docker/) on how to deploy a FastAPI application in Kubernetes.


## Standalone

### Introduction

Auditize supports **Python 3.12+**. This version of Python is available on Ubuntu 24.04+ and RHEL 9.4+ (among others) as time of writing.

In this section, we will build a standalone Auditize environment using:

- Auditize installed in a Python virtual environment
- Gunicorn with ASGI workers
- Nginx as a reverse proxy

**We assume that you have a working MongoDB instance available and the corresponding MongoDB URI to connect to it.**

Here, we take Ubuntu 24.04 as an example, but the steps should be similar for other Linux distributions (especially Debian-based ones and distros using `systemd`).

### Install and configure Auditize

First, install the `virtualenv` package and create a Python virtual environment with Auditize and Gunicorn:
```bash

sudo apt install -y python3-virtualenv
sudo virtualenv /opt/auditize
sudo /opt/auditize/bin/pip install auditize gunicorn
```

Create a `/opt/auditize/env` file containing your [Auditize configuration](config.md). It should contain at least the required fields `AUDITIZE_PUBLIC_URL`, `AUDITIZE_JWT_SIGNING_KEY`, and `AUDITIZE_MONGODB_URI` if your MongoDB server is not running locally:
```bash
AUDITIZE_PUBLIC_URL=...
AUDITIZE_JWT_SIGNING_KEY=...
AUDITIZE_MONGODB_URI=...
```

Then, ensure appropriate permissions and ownership on this file:
```bash
sudo chown www-data:www-data /opt/auditize/env
sudo chmod 660 /opt/auditize/env
```

Bootstrap the superadmin user:

```bash
sudo AUDITIZE_CONFIG=/opt/auditize/env /opt/auditize/bin/auditize bootstrap-superadmin YOUR_EMAIL YOUR_FIRST_NAME YOUR_LAST_NAME
```

The `auditize bootstrap-superadmin` command will prompt you for a password and then create the superadmin user.

!!! info

    The install path `/opt/auditize` can be changed to any other path you prefer (when doing so, make sure to adjust the paths in the following steps accordingly). We use the `www-data` user to run the services for simplicity, but you can choose to create a dedicated user for Auditize (you will have to ensure that the `/run/gunicorn.sock` socket file is still accessible by Nginx that runs as `www-data`).

### Run Auditize's scheduler with systemd

First, create a `/opt/auditize/log` directory to store the logs:

```bash
sudo mkdir /opt/auditize/log
sudo chown www-data:www-data /opt/auditize/log
```

Then, create a `/etc/systemd/system/auditize-scheduler.service` file with :

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Auditize Scheduler
After=network.target

[Service]
User=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/opt/auditize
EnvironmentFile=/opt/auditize/env
Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
ExecStart=/opt/auditize/bin/auditize schedule
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
StandardOutput=append:/opt/auditize/log/scheduler.log
StandardError=append:/opt/auditize/log/scheduler-error.log

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

And activate the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now auditize-scheduler
```

### Run Gunicorn with systemd

We are going to use `systemd` to create a UNIX socket for Gunicorn. Nginx will forward requests to this socket and `systemd` will start the Gunicorn service when the first request is received.

Create a `/etc/systemd/system/auditize-gunicorn.socket` file with:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Unix socket for Auditize Gunicorn

[Socket]
ListenStream=/run/gunicorn.sock
SocketUser=www-data
SocketGroup=www-data
SocketMode=0660

[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
```

Create a `/etc/systemd/system/auditize-gunicorn.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Run Auditize using Gunicorn
Requires=auditize-gunicorn.socket
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=notify
NotifyAccess=main
User=www-data
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/opt/auditize
EnvironmentFile=/opt/auditize/env
ExecStart=/opt/auditize/bin/gunicorn 'auditize:asgi()' \
  --error-logfile /opt/auditize/log/gunicorn.log \
  -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -w 4
ExecReload=/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID
KillMode=mixed
TimeoutStopSec=5
PrivateTmp=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

The `-w 4` option tells Gunicorn to run 4 workers. You can adjust this number according to your needs / host resources.

Enable and start the `auditize-gunicorn.socket` (`systemd` will start the `auditize-gunicorn.service` when needed) :

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now auditize-gunicorn.socket
```

### Setup Nginx

Install Nginx:

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

Add this Nginx configuration file at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/auditize`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_pass http://gunicorn;
    }
}

upstream gunicorn {
    server unix:/run/gunicorn.sock;
}
```

Remove the default Nginx configuration if any:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

Enable the Auditize configuration for Nginx:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/auditize /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/auditize
```

Restart Nginx:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

You can now access Auditize at `http://YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME` and log in with the superadmin user you created earlier.

#### TLS

It is of course highly recommended to use TLS for your Auditize instance. Here is an example of an Nginx configuration with TLS, it has been generated using the [Mozilla SSL Configuration Generator](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/) and it assumes that you have a valid certificate, private key, and DH parameter files in `/opt/auditize/ssl/`:

```nginx
# generated 2024-10-08, Mozilla Guideline v5.7, nginx 1.17.7, OpenSSL 1.1.1k, intermediate configuration
# https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/#server=nginx&version=1.17.7&config=intermediate&openssl=1.1.1k&guideline=5.7

}

    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;

        proxy_pass http://gunicorn;
    }
}

upstream gunicorn {
    server unix:/run/gunicorn.sock;
}
```


!!! warning

    Make sure that the files under `/opt/auditize/ssl/` have proper permissions:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod o-rwx /opt/auditize/ssl/*
    ```
