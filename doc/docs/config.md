# Configuration

| Variable                               | Required or default                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

If set, the configuration will be loaded from this file instead of environment variables.                                                                                                                                             |
| `AUDITIZE_PUBLIC_URL`                  | **Required**                          | The public URL of your Auditize instance from which your users access Auditize. It will be used for instance to build the URL of the application in emails sent to users.                                                                                                                                             |

It must be a long random string. A [32 bytes long key is recommended](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/34866) (i.e 64 characters in hexadecimal representation), you can generate one with the command `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
